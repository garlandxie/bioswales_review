AB The systems of spit bars that crop out in the area of linkage Atlantic-Mediterranean began to accumulate around 6,900 yr BP during the maximum of the Present Interglacial. From the morpho-sedimentological study of these spit bar systems, the study of littoral dynamics (particularly the littoral drift and interchange of ''superficial Atlantic water'' (SAW) and Mediterranean water), and the results of C-14 measurements, we have deduced that (a) the maximum of the Present Interglacial took place ca. 6.500 yr BP, (b) the progradation of spit bar systems relates to climate; anticyclonic conditions increase the entrance of ''superficial Atlantic Water'' into the Mediterranean, and enhance littoral drift favouring progradation. In contrast, the entrance of SAW decreases under low-pressure conditions causing reduced littoral drift, no progradation and, as a consequence, generation of the very large swales or erosional surfaces separating successive spits. (c) In the most complete case, four large prograding bodies called H-1, H-2, H-3 and H-4, can be distinguished, but more C-14 measurements are required to deduce more precise periodicities.

AB The water resources crisis facing countries of the Mediterranean Basin is reflected, in diminished form, in the semi-arid, ''Mediterranean-climate'' zone of Australia.  Some creative solutions involving the collection, treatment, storage, retrieval and use of storm runoff to replace the component of mains-supplied water presently used for ''second quality'' purposes, are emerging in Adelaide, capital city of South Australia.  The paper describes one initiative being taken to achieve source control of stormwater - quantity and quality - in mixed-density residential streets.  The resulting streetscape is suitable for use in both ''greenfields'' and re-development projects.  The paper explores the hydrological/hydraulic performance of the system and shows that it satisfies all theoretical requirements for safety in the full range of flooding up to and including the ''once in 100-years'' event.  The new streetscape holds the following advantages over conventional streetscapes : reduced peak outflows, greatly improved effluent water quality, aids ''greening'' of the landscape, potential for aquifer recharge where appropriate, aquifer retrieved groundwater can replace mains water used for irrigation, ''nuisance'' flows are fully contained (no surface appearance), major flows only occupy the swale, street residences are less flood prone and the streetscape fits more harmoniously into undulating terrain.

AB A class of wetland is introduced which employs engineering practices and installations to collect, store, dispose of, retrieve and use stormwater, at source, in the urban landscape. Two Adelaide (South Australia) examples of ''source wetlands'' are described. At New Brompton Estate, roof runoff from (eventually) a cluster of 15 residences is diverted to a 106 m gravel-filled trench in a central reserve. The collected water sustains a row of deciduous trees bordering the reserve and provides frequent (winter) charges, via a bore, to a Quaternary aquifer at depth 30 m.
   At Northfield a swale/trench system which handles all storm runoff from a residential street (including domestic contribution) will be trialled. Runoff seeping to the trench from the swale will be of high quality and will provide charges of water to a 5 m Quaternary aquifer. Some runoff of good quality will pass from the catchment in large storm events. In both cases, New Brompton and Northfield, water retrieved from the Quaternary aquifers in summer will be used for open space irrigation. Constructed source wetlands offer a valuable new option in urban stormwater quantity/quality management.

DT Article
AB This paper reports the results of a 1990 field survey of stormwater infiltration facilities constructed in Maryland pursuant to the Stormwater Management Act.  The study replicates investigations conducted in 1986.  Types of facilities inspected include infiltration basins and trenches, dry wells, porous pavement facilities, and vegetative swales. Analysis of field inspections reveals that the condition of facilities declined significantly in in four years.  Half the facilities are not functioning as designed, and two-thirds of the facilities need maintenance.  Dry wells and trenches are shown to be functioning as designed more frequently and to need less maintenance than porous pavement facilities and infiltration basins. The need for improvements in inspection and maintenance is noted.

AB This paper reports the findings of field inspections of more than 250 stormwater facilities in four counties in Maryland.  The types of facilities inspected include detention basins, infiltration basins and trenches, dry wells, underground storage facilities, and vegetated swales.  While most of the facilities are found to be functioning as designed, many needed maintenance.  Inspectors believe that enforcement action is warranted at many sites.  The condition of different types of facilities varies significantly.  Several models are used to explain results.  Overall, the investigations document the need for improved inspection and maintenance by stormwater management regulatory authorities.

TI NEW SITE FORMATION AND COLONIZING VEGETATION IN PRIMARY SUCCESSION ON
   THE WESTERN AMAZON FLOODPLAINS
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERSITY
AB (1) The major proportion of western Amazon forests grow on fluvial deposits and thus originated in floodplain environments. The fluviodynamic character of the sites initially colonized by plants was studied along different river types. and this information was combined with botanical observations from the same areas. Special emphasis was given to colonizing plant distribution and survival in relation to the abiotic environment. (2) Four frequently occurring landform types. each rich in microforms. were recognized in relation to the colonization process: fluvial bars, swales, abandoned channels and riverbanks. They are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the rivers and tend to be narrow, curved or linear patches. Local site and colonizing vegetation characteristics vary considerably between different river types (meandering or braided, rich or poor in suspended sediment). (3) The newly deposited fluvial sediments are poor in organic carbon and nitrogen. Colonization begins either with immigrant propagules dispersed by wind or water, or with the invasion of species by vegetative means. Usually numbers of individuals are few, and the initial vegetation pattern is a reflection of the small-scale mosaic of microsites. The pioneer flora (125 species recorded) includes many widespread perennial herbs, and seeds of most forest species do not germinate in the dry sediments. Herbaceous colonist species are almost non-existent in suspension-poor rivers of low erosion rate. (4) The persistence of the initial plant assemblage is controlled by the evolution of fluvial landforms. Only a few species among the set of colonists are significant in later forest succession. These include Tessaria integrifolia and Gynerium sagittatum, which resist moderate flood damage and resprout after burial. Mature seed populations of these 10- 15-m-tall species are abundant at the outermost margin of the successional forest just beyond the fluvial bars. The low representation of tree species in the colonizing phase suggests that the extreme environmental conditions at the river margins differ from other natural environments along the Amazon. (5) Aquatic succession on lakes affected by suspension-rich waters starts with genuine floating species. The general habits of these vegetation assemblages and their species composition are highly similar in the 'white-water' floodplains of the study area. An annual vegetation flush characteristically follows the flood period. On the other hand, macrophyte vegetation is almost non-existent on the floodplain lakes of suspension-poor rivers. (6) The Amazon floodplain corridors provide a good opportunity for ecological studies of plant colonization because basically similar succession is present at each meander along the rivers. Furthermore, the basic physiographic processes which form the sites and control their further evolution are both well known and measurable.

TI GEOMORPHIC CHANGE IMPLIED BY REGOLITH - SLOPE RELATIONSHIPS ON STEEPLAND
   HILLSLOPES, TARANAKI, NEW-ZEALAND
SO CATENA
LA English
DT Article
AB Slope angle and regolith depth were measured along profile lines covering a range of hillslopes in several small neighbouring drainage basins in Taranaki hill country, New Zealand.
   Slope measurements show a cyclic variation along the length of broadly rectilinear profiles. Variation in slope on the lower portion of profiles adjacent to stream channels indicates that hillslopes have undergone phases of accelerated downcutting and hillslope rejuvenation. A recent phase of increased erosion and hillslope rejuvenation is suggested for hillslopes steeper than 31-degrees by the steep lowerslope and incised stream channel. Hillslope evolution occurs primarily by parallel retreat of steeper swale sites and slope decline during pauses in the rate of downcutting.
   All slope profiles show a large range in regolith depth. Mean regolith depth of swale sites is highly correlated with mean profile slope angle. Mean regolith depth decreases and the frequency of landslides increase with increasing mean profile slope angle. Microtopographic variation in regolith depth is attributed mainly to vegetation effects, recurrent landsliding, and in-part to bedrock curvature, hillslope position, and slope angle. Shallowing of regolith is caused by recurrent landsliding on steep swale sites, fluvial erosion at the base of steep profiles, and surface erosion on extremely convex spur sites. The very shallow soil on the steep lowerslope portion of profiles suggests a phase of soil removal, consistent with hillslope rejuvenation.
   Average depth of regolith is least at 97 cm, and variability greatest, on hillslopes with a profile mean exceeding 31-degrees. Erosion rates are greater on these sites where soil is derived predominantly from underlying Tertiary sandstone. This is attributed to a greater frequency of landsliding compared to hillslopes with a profile slope less than 31-degrees where a more regular and deeper average regolith of 153 cm infers a longer period of hillslope stability consistent with the high volcanic ash content of soils. Airfall andesitic volcanic ash, deposited throughout the Holocene, has largely been removed from steeper sites.
   The work demonstrates the need to interpret the frequency and distribution of landslides in context with natural geomorphic changes in order to assess the effect that landuse changes has on erosion rates.

TI DEBRIS FLOWS AS GEOMORPHIC AGENTS IN THE HUACHUCA MOUNTAINS OF
   SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Numerous debris flows occurred in the Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona during the summer rainy season of 1988 in areas that were burned by a forest fire earlier in the summer. Debris flows occurred following a major forest fire in 1977 as well, suggesting a causal link between fires and debris flows. Abundant evidence of older debris flows preserved along channels and in mountain front fans indicates that debris flows have occurred repeatedly during the late Quaternary in this environment. Soil development in sequences of debris-flow deposits indicates that debris flows probably recur over time intervals of several hundred to a thousand years in individual drainage basins in the study area.
   Surface runoff in the steep drainage basins of the Huachuca Mountains is greatly enhanced following forest fires, as the hillslopes are denuded of their vegetative cover. Water and sediment eroded from the hillslope regolith are rapidly introduced into the upper reaches of tributary channels by widespread rilling and slope wash during rainfall events. This influx of water and sediment destabilizes regolith previously accumulated in the channel, triggering debris flows that scour the channel to bedrock in the upper reaches. Following a debris flow, the scoured, trapezoidally-shaped channel gradually assumes a swale shape and the percentage of exposed bedrock declines, as material is introduced from the slopes. Debris flows do a tremendous amount of work in a very short time, however, and are the major channel-forming events.
   Where the tributary channels enter larger, trunk channels, the debris flows serve as the main source of very coarse sediment. The local slope and coarse particle distribution of the trunk channel depend on the competence of water flows in the channel to transport the material introduced by debris flows. Where the smaller channels drain directly to the mountain front, debris flows create extensive alluvial fans which dominate the morphology of the basin-range boundary.
   Time intervals between debris flows in the drainage basins of the Huachuca Mountains are probably controlled by complex interactions among climate, forest f ires and slope processes. Fires destroy the protective vegetation that stabilizes the upper catchment slopes and inhibits erosion. However, not every fire that bums a catchment causes debris flows, because sufficient weathered material must accumulate in the upper channel reaches to initiate a large debris flow. If such accumulation has not occurred, the material introduced to a channel following a forest fire will move only a short distance down the channel. Thus, the episodic nature of debris flows probably depends on rates of slope weathering and erosion. which are in turn controlled by climate, both directly and through vegetation and forest fires.

TI SOME ALIGNED CLAYPANS IN THE STRZELECKI DUNEFIELD, CENTRAL AUSTRALIA
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE AEOLIAN; CLAYPANS; DUNEFIELD; PLEISTOCENE; STRZELECKI
ID DESERT DUNES
AB Sets of claypans in the Strzelecki dunefield are commonly aligned obliquely or almost perpendicular to the trend of longitudinal (seif) dunes.  The claypan alignments form an arcuate convex-north pattern in the dunefield.  Three types of claypan define the alignments:  (i) Floodflats and/or lakes associated with curved portions of modern or palaeoriver systems.  These were major sources of aeolian sediments.  (ii) Sets of small claypans developed downwind from lakebeds, including salt lakes, and from type 1 claypans.  These claypans form in swales between transverse dunes.  The swales are crossed by longitudinal dunes.  (iii) Claypans not associated with river systems or salt lakes.  These formed by wind erosion of the pre-existing land surface.
   The aligned claypans probably formed as a result of Pleistocene aeolian erosion and deposition, coincident with development of the dunefield.  The arcuate pattern probably reflects variations in wind-strength, greatest in the central area and lesser near rocky rises on the margin of the field.
   A previous explanation for the claypans is that they resulted from gradual diminution of a mega-lake, Lake Dieri, during the Late Tertiary to Late Quaternary.  There is evidence for extensive lacustrine facies during the Miocene-Pliocene, but many of the aligned claypans are developed on younger fluvial deposits.
   Undoubtedly the major existing lakes in the region have fluctuated in size during the Quaternary, but no evidence relates the aligned claypans to the previously proposed mega-lake.

DE WETLAND HISTORY; HUMAN IMPACT; WILDERNESS; GEOLOGY
AB We examined the geology of a small inland wetland in Hampton, Connecticut to determine its postglacial history and to assess the severity of human impact at this remote wooded site.  Using stratigraphic evidence, we demonstrate that the present wetland was created when sediment pollution from a 19th-century railroad filled a preexisting artificial reservoir, and that the prehistoric wetland was a narrow drainage swale along Hampton Brook.  This same, severely impacted wetland was interpreted by the Pulitzer Prize-winning naturalist Edwin Way Teale as a beautiful wilderness area of particular interest.  These conflicting perceptions indicate that artificial wetlands can be naturally mitigated in less than a century of healing, even in the absence of deliberate management.  We also point out that the "wilderness" value of the Teale wetland was in the eye of the beholder and that unseen human impacts may have improved the aesthetic experience.

DT Article
AB In present hydrologic practice, it is generally recognized that the shallow overland sheet flow through the upper portions of a watershed is very slow, and that runoff gradually accelerates as it concentrates into gullies and, finally, streams.  In this paper, the fractal concept is applied by testing whether a watershed's stream-and-swale system branches in a characteristic pattern that repeats itself into successively finer but similar segments.  Commonly used geometric, geomorphologic, hydraulic, and hydrologic equations are combined to reduce the number of parameters.  Kinematic wave equations are then developed for the runoff movement in the channels, and integrated to obtain an equation for the time of concentration.

ID LAKE-ONTARIO BASIN; DEFORMATION; RHEOLOGY; LOBE
AB The Peterborough drumlin field (5000 km2) is the largest in central Canada and was formed during readvance of the Laurentide ice sheet shortly after 13,000 B.P. Morphometric analysis of 998 drumlins, combined with study of 6921 borehole logs and downhole geophysical data, has established the distribution of drumlin types and their stratigraphy along a 70 km flow line through the drumlin field.  In the north, drumlins are spindle-shaped, composed of till resting directly on bedrock, and were formed by deformation of till into low-pressure zones in the lee of bedrock scarps.  Eskers record subglacial drainage by channeled meltwaters flowing on bedrock.  To the south, drift thickness increases and eskers are absent; drumlins are larger and more avoid and are composed of overridden proglacial and glaciolacustrine sediments overlain erosively by deformation till.  Till is thin over drumlin crests and thick in interdrumlin swales and records subglacial cannibalization and mixing of overridden sediments; the drumlin form is the product of erosion by streams of deforming till flowing in swales separating cores composed of older sediments.  Systematic down-field changes in drumlin shape and size can be related to decreased duration of subglacial deformation toward the limit of the readvance and increased thickness of preexisting sediments available for dissection by subglacial till streams.  Absence of eskers in the central and southern parts of the drumlin field suggests that the ice base was drained by mass flow of the deforming substrate.  The substantial subsurface data available from the Peterborough area indicate that drumlins are predominantly erosional in origin and are the geomorphological expression of a deforming subglacial bed below the margin of the Laurentide ice sheet.

AB Over 500 well logs and 153 cores have been used to map three erosion surfaces in the Viking Formation in the area of Garrington, Ferrier, Willesden Green, Crystal, Gilby and Joffre.  These erosion surfaces (Viking erosion surfaces VE2, VE3 and VE4), or bounding discontinuities, allow the definition of five informal allomembers (A through E) in the main Willesden Green study area.  Allomembers A and B contain regionally extensive, sandier-upward successions of bioturbated mudstones and sandstones.  The VE2 erosion surface cuts into allomembers A and B, and is characterized at Willesden Green by two channel segments that trend southwest-northeast and south-southeast-north-northwest.  The channels are up to 11 m deep, and are at the same stratigraphic level as the 30 m deep channel at Crystal.  Allomember C forms the channel fill, and comprises estuarine mudstones and sandstones, crossbedded sandstones, and clast supported conglomerates.  Allomember D contains sandstones and mudstones dominated by wave-formed sedimentary structures - both small ripples and hummocky cross-stratification.  This allomember becomes thicker and sandier southward, and passes into a thick, swaley cross-stratified clean sandstone at Garrington and Caroline.  These sandstones are truncated by the VE4 erosion surface, which rises stratigraphically southward, with at least 16 m of relative relief.  Allomember E, between VE4 and the Base of Fish Scales marker, contains interbedded black mudstones and thin tongues of conglomerate and granule sandstone.
   The sandier-upward successions in allomembers A and B are interpreted as aggrading, marine, open-shelf deposits.  A lowering of relative sea level resulted in the incision of fluvial drainage.  A subsequent rise of relative sea level resulted in the VE 3 ravinement surface, with river channels backfilling as estuaries.  Allomember D was deposited from a northward-prograding wave-dominated shoreface, but deposition was terminated by another fall of relative sea level.  The VE4 surface was probably cut subaerially, but was modified by erosive marine transgression.  A conglomeratic lag was formed on the surface, and pauses in trangression allowed the deposition of the coarse tongues in allomember E.  Continued trangression resulted in the deposition of the black shales in allomember E.
   This detailed allostratigraphy establishes the relative stratigraphic positions of the economic producing facies in the Caroline-Garrington, Ferrier-Willesden Green, and Crystal areas.  It also forms the basis for an interpretation of Viking depositional environments in the context of fluctuations of relative sea level.
